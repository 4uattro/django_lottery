# django_lottery
Django project about lottery tendencies

This repository contains screenshots of my ongoing Django project. The images show the Admin interface, where you can see a sneak peek of the ORM objects and their stats.

My current focus is on automating the data scraping process sustainably. Once that's accomplished, I'll shift my attention to developing the user-facing views for the processed stats.
